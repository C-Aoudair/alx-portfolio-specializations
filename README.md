## Overview
SkillSwap facilitates the exchange of services between users by matching their skill sets. The platform allows users to:
- Create and manage profiles.
- Search for profiles that match the skills they need.
- Communicate in real-time through an integrated chat system.

This platform is designed with a focus on user-friendliness, enabling seamless navigation and communication. The primary goal is to empower users to exchange skills efficiently without the need for monetary transactions.

## Technologies Used
### Backend:
- **Python** with **Django REST Framework**: Handles user authentication, profile management, and skill matching. The RESTful APIs are designed to be secure, scalable, and easy to integrate with the frontend.
- **Node.js** with **Express.js**: Manages the real-time chat functionality. Socket.IO is used to enable instant messaging between users, ensuring that communication is smooth and responsive.

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: Provides a dynamic and responsive user interface. React is chosen for its component-based architecture, which makes the codebase modular and maintainable. Material-UI is used for styling, ensuring a modern and consistent look across the application.

### Databases:
- **SQLite**: Used for storing user data and service-related information. SQLite is lightweight and easy to set up, making it ideal for development and small to medium-sized projects.
- **MongoDB**: Stores chat history and messages. MongoDB’s NoSQL structure allows for flexible storage of chat data, which can vary in size and structure.
- **Redis**: Implements caching and session management. Redis helps in reducing the load on the databases by storing frequently accessed data in memory, improving the application’s performance.

## Features
- **User Profiles:** 
  - Users can create and manage their profiles, including adding a profile picture, listing their skills, and detailing their experience.
  - Users can update their profile information at any time, ensuring that their skills and availability are always current.

- **Skill Matching:** 
  - The search functionality allows users to find others based on specific skills they are looking for. 
  - The matching algorithm considers both the skills users offer and those they need, providing the most relevant matches.

- **Real-Time Chat:** 
  - Users can communicate through a built-in chat system that supports real-time messaging.
  - The chat interface is intuitive, with a history of conversations easily accessible for users.

- **Responsive Design:** 
  - The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
  - The user interface adapts to different screen sizes, maintaining usability across various devices.
